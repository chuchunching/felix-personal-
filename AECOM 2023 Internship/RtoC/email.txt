Dear Ryan, 

I refer to the Consultant's preceding email enclosing the subject submission (Ref.: 13-03).  Please find below our observations/comments from air ventilation perspective for your further action: 

2.        Re. last bullet of para. 5.9.1 and relevant figure(s) in the report, and the last bullet of the recommendations in the Executive Summary (Appendix C) regarding the implementation/control mechanism of the mitigation measures, please cross reference to our comments on the Optimal Scheme and the Planning Report. 

3.        Executive Summary, English version, Way Forward – Please remove “To evaluate the effectiveness…at detailed design stage is suggested” as per our previous comments and to tally with the Chinese version. 

4.        Section 5.9 and Executive Summary (English and Chinese), Recommendation, last point – The following statements appear to be inconsistent with each other.  Please clarify/rectify. 
(a)        Section 5.9 - “…wind corridor and non-building area for air ventilation purpose shall not be outlined on plan in subsequent land sale document(s) and or on outline zoning plan”.  Please indicate such “wind corridor” and “non-building area” on a plan, or remove this sentence to avoid confusion if appropriate. 
(b)        Section 5.9 - “However, the recommendation in allowing building gaps of more than 15m in two major directions (see below Figure 5.8) are suggested to be included in statutory documents for the Development” 
(c)        Section 5.9 - “…details of further development restrictions to enhance air ventilation shall refer to relevant departments(s)’ decision in preparation of land tender and zoning” 
(d)        Executive Summary - “include in future Land Lease of two wind corridors to increase the effectiveness of the penetration of E and SSE winds”.  Please revise “wind corridors” to “building gaps” for the sake of consistency if appropriate. 

5.        The Consultant is reminded to ensure consistency across all deliverables.  As per our previous comment on the draft Planning Report (Ref: 20-01) conveyed to you via email on 25.5.2023, please review on the following: 
(a)        Section 5.9 and Executive Summary (English and Chinese), Recommendation - 
(i)        Point 2 – As per the identified prevailing wind directions, the Consultant may wish to consider if the building height should be minimised at the southern portion of the site.   
(ii)        Please incorporate ‘podium-free design’ as one of the recommendations as well. 
(b)        Executive Summary (English and Chinese), The Existing Conditions with Proposed Developments, 2nd Para., Line 4 – Please remove “and the empty bays” and “和空間” as it does not seem that there are empty bays in the proposed scheme.
