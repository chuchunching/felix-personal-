 I refer to to draft Planning Report (Ref.: 20-1).  While we note that you have revised the Optimal Scheme report, you are reminded that all report in FS including the Planning Report should be consistent and coherent while reading with reference to each report within the FS.  Our preliminary comment on the Planning Report and the shape files of the rezoning boundary is marked in the word file attached below: 



2.        Portions of the subject report has made reference to the Final WP on Optimal Scheme (Ref. 03-02), Draft Preliminary LVIA Report (Ref. 15-01) and Final Preliminary AVA-EE Report (Ref. 13-02), to which our comments are still outstanding and pending to be resolved.  Please ensure that the content of the subject report would be suitably updated and revised to tally with the latest version of all other deliverables, including the observations/comments below:   
(a)        Table 3.2 – It is noted that the domestic and non-domestic GFA has been revised from 320,000m2 and 15,900m2 in the WP on Optimal Scheme (Ref.: 03-02) to 324,000m2 and 16,900m2 respectively.  Please ensure that the development parameters tally across all deliverables of the Study. 
(b)        Para. 3.3.2, 5th line – As per our comment on the WP on Optimal Scheme (Ref.: 03-02) “the east-west green visual corridor” would be blocked by the proposed residential towers of about 95mPD at the western part of the site.  Please address our comment on illustrating any effective visual corridors and revise the subject report to tally with the WP. 
(c)        Para. 4.1.3, 6th line and Para. 4.4.1(d) – It may be misleading to state that prevailing wind “comes from both northeast and southeast directions through the centre of the Development Site”.  Please ensure that the prevailing wind directions identified tally with that under the Preliminary AVA-EE Report. 
(d)        Insert 9.1 – It is noted that the kindergarten is located at the centre of the site which does not tally with Figure No. 60681377/A20/004.  Please update/rectify. 
(e)        Para. 9.2.3 – 
(i)        Please revise with reference our comment on the conclusion of the Preliminary AVA-EE Report (Ref. 13-02) in that the Ma Wan Park is also a wind sensitive area which is being affected by the proposed development when compared to the baseline condition. 
(ii)        Line 4 – Please remove “and the empty bays” as it does not seem that there are empty bays in the proposed scheme. 
(f)        Para. 9.3.1  – 
(i)        Item 2 – As per the identified prevailing wind directions, the Consultant may wish to consider if the building height should be minimised at the southern portion of the site.   
(ii)        Please incorporate ‘podium-free design’ as one of the recommendations as well. 
(g)        Table 10.1 and Figure No. 60681377/A20/033 – It is noted that VP5 (Tai Leng Tau), VP6 (Shek Wan) and VP7 (Ma Wan Public Pier) have been added compared to the Preliminary LVIA Report (Ref. 15-01).  We reserve our comments on the ratings of visual impact until the receipt of a revised LVIA which would presumably include these newly added VPs.  Please ensure that the subject report would tally with the finalised version of the LVIA.   
(h)        Figure No. 60681377/A20/033 – It does not seem that the locations of VSRs T1 and T2 are annotated accurately.  Please rectify. 
(i)        Para. 10.1.1 – Please describe any committed/planned development in the vicinity in particular the planned Tsing Yi-Lantau Link, and include them in the relevant photomontage(s). 
(j)        Para. 10.3.1 – Please consider revising to read as “…to soften the bulky podium of the Proposed Development” as there appears to be no podium in the proposed scheme. 
(k)        Paras. 10.3.2 and 10.3.3 – Please note that sunlight penetration is not under the purview of Planning Department. 
(l)        Para. 10.3.8 – It cannot be ascertained at this stage that the resultant overall visual impact can be concluded as “slightly adverse”.  While we reserve our comments on the conclusion until the receipt of a revised LVIA, the Consultant is advised to conclude with the range of visual impact as assessed from all VPs e.g. “slightly adverse” to “significantly adverse” according to Table 10.1. 
(m)        The Consultant is reminded that the subject report should be prepared in support of the upcoming rezoning exercise and should include the summary of relevant technical assessments.  Please ensure that sufficient visual illustrations e.g. photomontages would be included in the subject report.
3.        We reserve our detailed comments on the subject report until the relevant deliverables such as Working Paper on Optimal Scheme, Preliminary LVIA Report and Preliminary AVA-EE Report are finalised. 

4.        It is noted that “…there are approximately 2500 existing trees found on site” in para 10.4.2. However, our comment on the latest OLP, “it is noted approximately 2,800 nos. of trees are identified in the study which would be felled due to the proposed development…approximately 2,800 nos. of trees with a ratio of 1:1 tree compensation in quantity would be planted on the proposed development site by woodland mix planting on slope and climbers/shrubs planting on the slope or associated structures”. The Consultant should update all relevant landscape related information and ensure consistency among all the submissions of the Project. 

5.         You may find some comments in the word file duplicate with the above comments.  Please ensure our comments are adequately addressed.
